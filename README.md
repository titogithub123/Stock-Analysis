# Stock-Analysis - VBA For Stock Analysis
## What Can We Learn From Analysising Stocks Using VBA
### Project Overview:
  The purpose of the project was to compare the return rate for a handful of selected stocks to see which ones might be most beneficial for our friend Steve's parents to consider investing in. They have worked hard for many years to save up a small little nest egg for their retirement and they want to invest a portion of thier savings in a profitable stock opportunity. They have asked Steve to help them analyze a short list of possible candidates to see if there is one or two the will consider investing in. 
  
### Results 
  We have created a spreadsheet that runs analysis on previous stocks return performance for the years 2017 and 2018. We have attempted to make the results of our analysis as clear as possible by including conditional formatting that let's us know at a glance how well the stocks in our test cases performed over the last couple of years. By filling in green those stocks that had a positve return and formatting in red those that had a negative return, we can see quickly which ones performed best over all.
  
### Code that shows the conditional formatting that fills in positive return values in green and negative return values in red.

As we can see from the results the stocks in 2018 perfomred at a much lower level than the majority of stocks from 2017. From the information we can gather form our analysis it looks like the best stocks to invest in with the greatest opportunity of a positive return will be the "ENPH" and "RUN" stocks.
